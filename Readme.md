# cue.ninja

![screen shot](content/screenshot.png)

cue.ninja will be a cross plaform data query tool.  
There are several tools out there that are more more feture rich and complete, I wanted a tool that was more light weight.

So far all you can do is edit a sql statment, so its no better than nodepad!
